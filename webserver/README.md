# GraphPart webserver

This server runs the GraphPart algorithm for homology partitioning of biological sequence datasets. 

Note that the BioLib implementation will time out on large datasets, especially when using EMBOSS needle alignments. We recommend using the [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/graph-part/) for larger datasets and full feature support.

Documentation about the algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/graph-part/graph-part
